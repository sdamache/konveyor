    {
      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Setup Semantic Kernel Framework and Azure OpenAI Integration",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Semantic Kernel framework setup and Azure OpenAI integration into logical implementation steps, including directory structure creation, kernel configuration, Azure integration, and testing components.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves setting up a new framework with cloud service integration, requiring technical expertise in both Semantic Kernel and Azure OpenAI. It includes multiple components (directory structure, kernel configuration, Azure integration, memory setup, logging) and requires knowledge of existing systems (Key Vault, azure_utils). The testing requirement adds another layer of complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Agent Orchestration Layer and Slack Integration",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation steps for creating an agent orchestration layer that connects Semantic Kernel with Slack, including message handling, intent parsing, skill routing, response formatting, and conversation management.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to its central role in the system architecture. It requires integrating multiple components (Slack, Semantic Kernel) and implementing sophisticated logic (intent parsing, skill routing). It also handles critical functions like error management and thread/conversation context tracking. The orchestration layer must be robust as it's a potential single point of failure."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Create Documentation Navigator Skill with Search Service Integration",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Define the implementation steps for the Documentation Navigator skill, including query preprocessing, search service integration, response formatting, citation handling, and conversation context management.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves wrapping an existing service (SearchService) and adding new functionality. While moderately complex, it builds on existing components. The complexity comes from implementing query preprocessing, maintaining conversation context, and implementing caching. The formatting and citation requirements add additional work but are relatively straightforward."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Code Understanding Skill with Language Detection",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the Code Understanding skill into steps covering language detection, code parsing, explanation generation with prompt templates, and Slack-compatible formatting with syntax highlighting.",
      "reasoning": "This task has significant complexity due to the technical challenges of code parsing and language detection. Creating effective prompt templates for code explanation requires domain expertise. The task also requires integration with architectural documentation and robust error handling for various code inputs. Supporting multiple programming languages adds additional complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Define Knowledge Taxonomy and Implement Knowledge Gap Analyzer Skill",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for creating a knowledge taxonomy system and implementing the Knowledge Gap Analyzer skill, including taxonomy definition, question mapping, user profile management, confidence scoring, and recommendation generation.",
      "reasoning": "This task combines knowledge engineering (taxonomy creation) with implementation of a sophisticated analysis system. It requires maintaining user profiles, calculating confidence scores, identifying knowledge gaps, and generating personalized recommendations. The persistence requirements and integration with other skills add complexity. This task has both conceptual and technical challenges."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Feedback Mechanism in Slack",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Outline the implementation steps for a Slack-based feedback system using reactions, including reaction option addition, reaction capture and handling, and feedback data storage and logging.",
      "reasoning": "This task is moderately complex, primarily involving Slack API integration for reaction handling. The implementation includes adding reaction options, capturing user reactions, and storing feedback data. While it requires careful integration with the existing orchestration layer, the scope is relatively contained and the technical challenges are manageable."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Define and Implement Infrastructure as Code for Deployment",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of updating Terraform configurations for deployment infrastructure, including resource definition, networking and security setup, environment configuration, and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves defining infrastructure as code using Terraform, which requires expertise in both cloud architecture and Terraform syntax. It covers multiple resource types (App Service, OpenAI, Cognitive Search, Storage) and includes networking, security, and configuration concerns. The documentation requirement adds additional work. The task has significant complexity due to its breadth and technical depth."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement CI Pipeline for Testing and Docker Image Building",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for implementing a GitHub Actions CI pipeline, including linting configuration, test execution setup, Docker image building process, and container registry integration.",
      "reasoning": "Setting up a CI pipeline requires understanding of GitHub Actions, Docker, and testing frameworks. The task includes multiple workflow components (linting, testing, building, pushing) and requires careful configuration. While technically complex, this is a relatively standard DevOps task with good documentation and examples available."

      "taskTitle": "Implement CD Pipeline for Application Deployment",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Outline the implementation steps for a GitHub Actions CD pipeline, including manual approval workflow, environment-specific deployment configuration, post-deployment verification, and rollback procedures.",
      "reasoning": "This task extends the CI pipeline to include deployment capabilities, which adds complexity. It requires environment-specific configurations, approval workflows, and verification steps. The multi-environment support (dev, test, prod) and rollback procedures add significant complexity. This task requires expertise in both GitHub Actions and Azure deployment services."

      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Integration Tests and Documentation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of comprehensive integration tests and documentation updates, including test scenario development, documentation structure planning, architecture documentation updates, and user guide creation.",
      "reasoning": "This task combines two significant areas: integration testing and comprehensive documentation. The testing must cover multiple complex user flows across several integrated components. The documentation updates span multiple documents and must accurately reflect the implemented architecture and usage patterns. The breadth of this task and its dependencies on multiple other tasks contribute to its complexity."
