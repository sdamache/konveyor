      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Set up Semantic Kernel Framework",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Semantic Kernel framework setup into detailed technical steps, including directory structure creation, SDK initialization, Azure OpenAI integration with Key Vault credentials, and memory system configuration.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves setting up a complex framework with Azure OpenAI integration and credential management. It requires understanding of the Semantic Kernel architecture, Azure services, and secure credential handling, making it moderately complex."

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Agent Orchestration Layer",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the specific components needed for the agent orchestration layer, including request handling, intent determination logic, routing mechanisms to skills, Slack integration points, and error handling patterns.",
      "reasoning": "Creating an orchestration layer requires sophisticated routing logic, intent determination, and integration with both Slack and the Semantic Kernel framework. The complexity comes from designing a flexible architecture that can handle various types of requests and route them appropriately."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Create Documentation Navigator Skill",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Documentation Navigator skill implementation into steps covering the SearchService wrapper creation, query preprocessing for onboarding questions, integration with the Semantic Kernel framework, and testing with sample queries.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves wrapping an existing service as a Semantic Kernel tool and implementing query preprocessing. While it builds on existing components, understanding how to properly integrate with Semantic Kernel and handle query preprocessing adds moderate complexity."

    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Response Formatting for Slack",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for implementing Slack-compatible response formatting, including Markdown conversion rules, citation formatting logic, and integration with the Documentation Navigator skill.",
      "reasoning": "This task is focused on formatting and presentation rather than complex logic. While it requires understanding Slack's Markdown capabilities and citation formatting, the overall complexity is moderate to low."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Code Understanding Skill",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Code Understanding skill implementation into detailed steps covering language detection, code structure analysis, prompt template creation for different programming languages, architectural context integration, and testing with diverse code samples.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex natural language processing and code analysis. Creating a system that can understand and explain code patterns requires sophisticated prompt engineering and language-specific handling, making it one of the most complex tasks."

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Code Response Formatting",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation steps for code response formatting, including syntax highlighting for different languages, error handling for malformed code, and Slack-specific formatting considerations.",
      "reasoning": "Similar to Task 4, this task focuses on presentation rather than complex logic. The syntax highlighting and error handling add some complexity, but the scope is relatively contained."

    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Create Knowledge Taxonomy and Gap Analyzer",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Knowledge Gap Analyzer implementation into steps covering taxonomy definition, question analysis mechanisms, taxonomy mapping algorithms, and integration with the agent orchestration layer.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires defining a knowledge taxonomy and implementing algorithms to map questions to that taxonomy. The conceptual complexity of designing an effective taxonomy combined with the technical implementation makes this a highly complex task."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement User Knowledge Tracking",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for implementing user knowledge tracking, including confidence score data structures, update mechanisms, gap identification algorithms, and recommendation generation logic.",
      "reasoning": "Tracking user knowledge involves designing data structures for confidence scores and algorithms for identifying gaps. The complexity comes from creating an effective system that can accurately track and represent user knowledge across different areas."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Feedback Mechanism",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the feedback mechanism implementation into steps covering Slack reaction button integration, feedback capture logic, and feedback storage/logging system design.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves integrating with Slack's reaction system and designing a feedback logging mechanism. While it requires understanding Slack's API and designing a feedback storage system, the overall complexity is moderate."
