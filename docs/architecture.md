# Konveyor Architecture

## Overview

Konveyor follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns. The system is built with Django as the backend framework, with a focus on API-driven development to support multiple frontends.

## Components

### Backend (Django)

- **Core App**: Base functionality, utilities, and shared models
- **Users App**: User management, profiles, and authentication
- **API App**: REST API endpoints for integration with frontends and Azure services

### Azure Services

- **Azure OpenAI**: Provides AI capabilities for question answering and knowledge extraction
- **Azure Cognitive Search**: Indexes documents for efficient retrieval
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Stores static files and documents
- **Azure Database for PostgreSQL**: Persistent data storage
- **Azure Key Vault**: Secure storage of secrets and credentials
- **Azure Application Insights**: Monitoring and observability

## Data Flow

1. User submits a query or uploads a document
2. Django backend processes the request
3. For knowledge queries:
   - Query is sent to Azure OpenAI
   - Azure OpenAI processes the query using the organization's knowledge base
   - Results are returned to the user
4. For document uploads:
   - Document is stored in Azure Blob Storage
   - Document is indexed by Azure Cognitive Search
   - Azure OpenAI extracts key information from the document

## Security

- All communication is secured via HTTPS
- Authentication is handled via OAuth 2.0
- Sensitive configuration is stored in Azure Key Vault
- Access control is implemented at the API level

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time notifications via WebSockets
- Integration with Microsoft Teams
- Mobile application support
- Advanced analytics dashboard
