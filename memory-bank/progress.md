# Progress: Konveyor

## What Works

- **Infrastructure and CI/CD (Task 1 - Completed)**:
  - Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform) provisions all key Azure resources: App Service, Cognitive Search, Key Vault, OpenAI, Document Intelligence, Storage, Bot Service, and RAG infrastructure.
  - GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD (build and deploy to Azure App Service) is present and configured.
  - Feature-branch naming conventions, PR review requirements, and Conventional Commits formatting are enforced.

- **Semantic Kernel Framework (Task 2 - Functionally Implemented)**:
  - Directory structure at 'konveyor/skills/' for Semantic Kernel skills is established.
  - Semantic Kernel integration with Azure OpenAI using Key Vault credentials is implemented.
  - Basic volatile memory system for session-based data storage is configured.
  - Example ChatSkill with basic chat functionality and utility functions is created.
  - Basic Bot Framework integration with message handling is in place.

- **Core Application Components**:
  - Core Django application modules for documents, search, RAG, and core utilities are implemented and structured.
  - Azure Cognitive Search is integrated and used for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in the current demo.
  - Document ingestion, chunking, embedding, and indexing workflows are functional.
  - Unit and integration test scaffolding exists for core RAG workflows and services.

## What's Left to Build

- **Task 2 Status Update:** While functionally implemented, Task 2 (Semantic Kernel Framework) is still marked as "pending" in tasks.json and needs to be updated to "done".
- **Agent Orchestration (Task 3):** The orchestration layer for routing requests to Semantic Kernel skills/tools needs to be fully implemented, building on the existing Bot Framework integration.
- **Redundancy Resolution:** Address overlap between new ChatSkill and existing RAG implementation in conversation history management, message formatting, and Azure OpenAI integration.
- **Semantic Kernel Skills:** Documentation Navigator, Code Understanding, and Knowledge Gap Analyzer skills are not yet complete or integrated.
- **Slack Integration:** While basic Bot Framework integration exists, Slack-specific integration is incomplete; the agent is not yet accessible via Slack.
- **Azure App Service Deployment Validation:** The Django application must be deployed and validated on Azure App Service to confirm end-to-end Azure integration and production readiness.
- **Redis Cache and Cosmos DB:** These are not active; all retrieval and context are currently handled via Azure AI Search. Transition to Redis/Cosmos DB for cost optimization is planned for the future.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Needs enhancement for integration testing and automated deployment to Azure App Service.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Full system integration and user journey tests are pending.
- **Documentation and Demo:** Comprehensive user and architecture documentation, as well as a demo script, are not yet finalized.

## Current Status

- The project is in an advanced development stage but is not yet end-to-end demo-ready.
- Task 1 (Infrastructure and CI/CD) is fully completed and marked as "done" in tasks.json.
- Task 2 (Semantic Kernel Framework) is functionally implemented but still marked as "pending" in tasks.json.
- Infrastructure provisioning and CI/CD setup are implemented and active; pending validation of Azure App Service deployment.
- Semantic Kernel framework is set up with Azure OpenAI integration and a basic volatile memory system.
- Basic Bot Framework integration is in place but needs further development for Slack integration.
- Retrieval and RAG features work using Azure AI Search, but advanced agentic features (Semantic Kernel skills, orchestration, chat integration) are still in progress.
- The next steps and implementation plan are defined in detail in the tasks folder and scripts/prd_draft_for_ai.txt, which should be followed to complete the MVP.
- The task plan from tasks.json is the authoritative roadmap for all further development.

## Known Issues

- No active Redis cache or Cosmos DB for conversation context; all context is handled via Azure AI Search.
- Redundancy between ChatSkill and existing RAG implementation needs to be addressed.
- Task 2 is functionally implemented but still marked as "pending" in tasks.json.
- Bot integration is incomplete; basic Bot Framework integration exists but no Slack interface for the agent.
- App Service deployment is missing, blocking full Azure integration testing.
- Some infrastructure modules may require updates or fixes for production deployment.
- End-to-end and user journey tests are not yet implemented.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Initial focus on Azure AI Search for rapid demo; Redis and Cosmos DB are planned for future cost and performance optimization.
- Adoption of Semantic Kernel framework for implementing AI-driven skills and agent orchestration.
- Decision to implement a basic volatile memory system initially, with plans to extend to persistent memory in the future.
- Modular infrastructure and codebase design to support phased rollout of agentic features and cloud services.
- Task breakdown and development roadmap are managed via the tasks folder and PRD draft for AI-driven, structured implementation.
- Recognition of redundancy between new Semantic Kernel skills and existing RAG implementation, requiring future consolidation.
