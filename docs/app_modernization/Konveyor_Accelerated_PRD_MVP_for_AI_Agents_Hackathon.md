# Konveyor Accelerated PRD: MVP for AI Agents Hackathon

## Overview

Konveyor is an AI-powered knowledge transfer agent designed to solve the critical challenges in software engineer onboarding. This accelerated PRD outlines the minimum viable product (MVP) for the AI Agents Hackathon, with a focus on delivering unique differentiators that will set Konveyor apart from other agent implementations within the 14-day timeframe.

## Unique Value Proposition

While many hackathon participants will build generic AI agents with simple prompts, Konveyor differentiates itself by:

1. **Solving a Real Business Problem**: Directly addressing the $30,000+ cost of onboarding each new software engineer
2. **Leveraging Existing Infrastructure**: Using your already-built document processing, search, and RAG capabilities
3. **Domain-Specific Knowledge**: Focusing on software engineering knowledge transfer rather than general-purpose assistance
4. **Contextual Understanding**: Providing answers that incorporate organizational context and architectural decisions
5. **Agentic Framework with Specialized Tools**: Creating purpose-built tools for code understanding and knowledge gap analysis

## Business Impact

The $30,000+ cost per engineer onboarding is derived from:
- Lost productivity during ramp-up (1-3 months at full salary)
- Mentor/senior engineer time spent on knowledge transfer (reducing their productivity)
- HR and administrative costs
- Training resources and materials
- Opportunity costs from delayed project contributions

For a mid-level software engineer with a \$120,000 annual salary, this can easily exceed \$30,000 when accounting for all these factors, especially considering that full productivity might not be reached for 3-6 months.

## MVP Scope

The MVP will focus on three core capabilities that showcase the power of the agentic approach:

1. **Documentation Navigator**: Help new engineers find and understand organizational documentation
2. **Code Understanding**: Explain code snippets and architectural decisions
3. **Knowledge Gap Analyzer**: Identify and address knowledge gaps during onboarding

The architecture diagram shows how the agentic framework integrates with your existing infrastructure:

1. **Existing Infrastructure**: Your current Azure services (OpenAI, Cognitive Search, Storage, Cosmos DB)
2. **Semantic Kernel**: The core agentic framework that orchestrates the specialized tools
3. **Specialized Tools**: Documentation Navigator, Code Understanding, Knowledge Gap Analyzer, and Agent Memory
4. **Slack Integration**: The user interface for interacting with the agent

## Unique Differentiators Implementation

### 1. Contextual Understanding

**Implementation:**
- Create a context-aware prompt system that incorporates:
  - Organizational terminology and jargon
  - Project-specific architectural decisions
  - Team structure and responsibilities
  - Technology stack and conventions

**Example:**
```python
class ContextAwarePromptSkill:
    def __init__(self, kernel):
        self.kernel = kernel
        self.org_context = self._load_org_context()

    def enhance_prompt(self, query, user_role, team):
        # Enhance the prompt with organizational context
        enhanced_prompt = f"""
        Given that you're helping a {user_role} on the {team} team,
        and considering our organization uses {self.org_context['tech_stack']},
        with architecture decisions like {self.org_context['architecture_decisions']},
        answer the following question: {query}
        """
        return enhanced_prompt
```

### 2. Knowledge Gap Detection

**Implementation:**
- Create a knowledge taxonomy specific to software engineering onboarding
- Implement a Bayesian knowledge model that updates confidence scores based on interactions
- Develop a recommendation engine that suggests resources based on detected gaps

**Example:**
```python
class KnowledgeGapDetectorSkill:
    def __init__(self, kernel):
        self.kernel = kernel
        self.knowledge_taxonomy = self._load_taxonomy()
        self.user_knowledge = {}

    def detect_gaps(self, query, user_id):
        # Analyze query to identify knowledge areas
        relevant_areas = self._map_query_to_areas(query)

        # Update confidence scores
        for area in relevant_areas:
            if area not in self.user_knowledge.get(user_id, {}):
                self.user_knowledge.setdefault(user_id, {})[area] = 0.2  # Initial low confidence

        # Identify gaps (areas with low confidence)
        gaps = [area for area, confidence in self.user_knowledge.get(user_id, {}).items()
                if confidence < 0.6]

        return gaps
```

### 3. Code Context Extraction

**Implementation:**
- Develop a specialized skill that extracts contextual information from code
- Create a system that identifies organizational patterns and conventions
- Implement explanation generation that references architectural decisions

**Example:**
```python
class CodeContextExtractorSkill:
    def __init__(self, kernel):
        self.kernel = kernel
        self.code_patterns = self._load_code_patterns()

    def extract_context(self, code_snippet, language):
        # Parse code to identify structures
        parsed_code = self._parse_code(code_snippet, language)

        # Identify organizational patterns
        patterns_found = self._identify_patterns(parsed_code)

        # Extract architectural context
        arch_context = self._extract_architectural_context(patterns_found)

        return {
            "patterns": patterns_found,
            "architectural_context": arch_context,
            "conventions": self._identify_conventions(parsed_code)
        }
```

## Cost Optimization Strategies

To address concerns about Azure AI search costs while maintaining MVP quality:

1. **Implement Tiered Search**
   - Use keyword search first, only escalating to vector search when necessary
   - Create a simple decision tree for search method selection

2. **Aggressive Caching**
   - Cache search results for common onboarding questions
   - Implement in-memory cache for development with Redis for production

3. **Batch Processing**
   - Group document operations to minimize API calls
   - Implement asynchronous processing for non-urgent tasks

4. **Development Mode Toggle**
   - Create a simple toggle for development vs. production mode
   - Use simulated responses during development

- **Azure AI Services**: Deeply integrate with Azure OpenAI, Cognitive Search, and other Azure services
- **Practical Application**: Solve a real business problem rather than a theoretical demonstration

## Project Pitch

### The Problem
Software engineer onboarding is broken. It costs organizations over $30,000 per engineer in lost productivity, mentor time, and delayed project contributions. New engineers struggle with scattered documentation, undocumented code, and tribal knowledge locked in the heads of busy senior engineers.

### The Solution
Konveyor is an AI-powered knowledge transfer agent that transforms software engineer onboarding. By leveraging the agentic framework approach with Semantic Kernel, Konveyor:

1. **Answers questions about documentation** with proper context and citations
2. **Explains code snippets** with architectural insights and design decisions
3. **Identifies knowledge gaps** and creates personalized learning paths

### The Differentiator
Unlike generic AI assistants, Konveyor is purpose-built for software engineering knowledge transfer. It understands organizational context, code patterns, and the specific challenges of technical onboarding. By integrating with existing tools through Slack, it meets engineers where they already work.

### The Impact
Konveyor reduces onboarding time by 30-50%, saving organizations thousands of dollars per engineer while improving the new hire experience. Senior engineers spend 40-60% less time on repetitive knowledge transfer, allowing them to focus on high-value work.

### The Implementation
Built on Microsoft's Semantic Kernel framework and Azure AI services, Konveyor transforms existing infrastructure into a powerful knowledge transfer agent. Its modular design allows for rapid implementation and future expansion.

## Conclusion

This super-accelerated PRD provides a focused roadmap for delivering a minimum viable product for the AI Agents Hackathon within the 14-day timeframe. By leveraging your existing infrastructure and focusing on the unique challenges of software engineer onboarding, Konveyor offers a compelling solution with clear business value and technical innovation that directly addresses the hackathon judging criteria.
