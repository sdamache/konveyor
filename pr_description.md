# Fix Linting Issues and Add Pre-commit Hooks

This PR fixes linting issues in the codebase and adds pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality in the CI/CD pipeline.

## What does this PR do?

1. Fixes existing linting issues (black, flake8, isort)
2. Adds pre-commit hooks to catch issues before they're committed
3. Updates the CI/CD workflow to include pre-commit checks
4. Adds documentation for pre-commit hooks

## Why is this PR needed?

To maintain code quality and consistency across the codebase, we need to enforce linting standards. This PR ensures that:
- Code follows consistent formatting (black)
- Imports are properly organized (isort)
- Common code issues are caught early (flake8)
- Type hints are gradually enforced (mypy)

## How was this PR tested?

- Ran pre-commit hooks locally to verify all checks pass
- Tested the updated CI/CD workflow

## What changes were made?

- Added `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with hooks for:
  - trailing-whitespace, end-of-file-fixer, check-yaml, debug-statements
  - isort with black profile
  - black formatter
  - flake8 linter
  - mypy type checker
- Created documentation for pre-commit hooks in `docs/development/pre-commit.md`
- Updated `.flake8` configuration to ignore E402 (module level import not at top of file) for scripts
- Created `mypy.ini` to configure type checking
- Fixed formatting issues in Python files
- Updated CI/CD workflow to include pre-commit checks

## Benefits

- Ensures consistent code style across the codebase
- Makes the CI/CD pipeline pass successfully
- Improves code readability and maintainability
- Catches issues before they're committed

## Additional notes

The mypy configuration is currently set to be very permissive to avoid blocking the pipeline. In the future, we should gradually make the type checking more strict as we add proper type annotations to the codebase.
