## 🌟 The Problem: Broken Engineer Onboarding

Every organization faces the same painful reality: **software engineer onboarding is fundamentally broken**. This isn't just an inconvenience—it's a $30,000+ cost per engineer in:

- 💸 Lost productivity during 1-3 months of ramp-up
- ⏱️ Senior engineer time diverted to repetitive knowledge transfer
- 📉 Delayed project contributions and missed deadlines
- 😓 Frustration and cognitive overload for new hires

The root causes are universal:
- 📚 Scattered, outdated, or non-existent documentation
- 🧩 Knowledge silos and tribal information
- 🗺️ Overwhelming or unstructured onboarding experiences
- 🔍 Difficulty understanding complex, undocumented codebases
- 👥 Limited access to mentorship from senior engineers

## 💡 The Solution: Konveyor

Konveyor is an AI-powered knowledge transfer agent designed specifically for software engineer onboarding. Unlike generic AI assistants, Konveyor is purpose-built to understand engineering context, codebase architecture, and the unique challenges of technical onboarding.

Built on Microsoft's Semantic Kernel framework and Azure AI services, Konveyor transforms existing infrastructure into a powerful knowledge transfer agent that:

1. **Answers questions about documentation** with proper context and citations
2. **Explains code snippets** with architectural insights and design decisions
3. **Identifies knowledge gaps** and creates personalized learning paths

## 🛠️ Key Features

### 📚 Documentation Navigator
- Searches and retrieves relevant documentation with context awareness
- Preprocesses queries to understand onboarding-related questions
- Formats responses with proper source citations
- Maintains conversation context for natural follow-up questions

### 💻 Code Understanding
- Parses and explains code snippets with language detection
- Analyzes code structure and organizational patterns
- Generates clear explanations with syntax highlighting
- Connects code explanations to architectural context

### 🧩 Knowledge Gap Analyzer
- Maps questions to a taxonomy of knowledge areas
- Tracks user confidence across different domains
- Identifies potential knowledge gaps
- Suggests relevant resources for learning

### 💬 Slack Integration
- Seamless interaction through familiar chat interface
- Thread support for organized conversations
- Rich message formatting for code and technical content
- Slash commands for specialized functionality

## 🏗️ Architecture

Konveyor is built on a modern, modular architecture:

- **Microsoft Semantic Kernel** for AI orchestration and skill management
- **Azure OpenAI** for advanced language understanding and generation
- **Azure Cognitive Search** for semantic document retrieval
- **Azure Key Vault** for secure credential management
- **Slack Bot Framework** for user interaction

The system follows an agent-based architecture with specialized skills that can be invoked based on user needs. A memory system maintains conversation context and tracks user knowledge.
