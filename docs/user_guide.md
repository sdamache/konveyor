## 1. Introduction

Konveyor is an AI-powered knowledge transfer agent designed to facilitate onboarding and knowledge sharing within organizations. It integrates with Slack to provide seamless access to organizational knowledge, code explanations, and personalized learning recommendations.

This guide will help you understand how to interact with Konveyor in Slack and make the most of its features.

## 2. Getting Started

### 2.1 Accessing Konveyor

Konveyor is available as a Slack app in your workspace. You can interact with it in two ways:

1. **Direct Messages**: Send private messages to the Konveyor bot
2. **Channel Interactions**: Mention @Konveyor in any channel where the bot is present

### 2.2 Authentication

Konveyor uses your Slack identity for authentication. No additional login is required to use the basic features. For certain administrative functions, you may need additional permissions configured by your workspace administrator.

## 3. Interacting with Konveyor in Slack

### 3.1 Direct Messages

To start a conversation with Konveyor:

1. Open Slack and navigate to the Direct Messages section
2. Find or search for "Konveyor"
3. Send a message to start interacting

Example:
```
Hello, I'm new to the team and looking for information about our API documentation.
```

### 3.2 Channel Interactions

To interact with Konveyor in a channel:

1. Ensure Konveyor is added to the channel (ask your administrator if it's not)
2. Mention @Konveyor followed by your question or request

Example:
```
@Konveyor Can you explain how our authentication system works?
```

### 3.3 Slash Commands

Konveyor provides several slash commands for quick access to specific features:

- `/konveyor-docs [query]`: Search documentation
- `/konveyor-code [language]`: Prepare for code explanation
- `/konveyor-analyze`: Analyze your knowledge gaps
- `/konveyor-help`: Display help information

Example:
```
/konveyor-docs deployment process
```

## 4. Core Features

### 4.1 Documentation Navigator

The Documentation Navigator helps you find relevant information in your organization's documentation.

**How to use it:**

1. Ask a question about any documented topic
   ```
   How do I set up my development environment?
   ```

2. Specify the type of documentation you're looking for
   ```
   Where can I find the API documentation for the user service?
   ```

3. Request specific information
   ```
   What are the required environment variables for local development?
   ```

Konveyor will search the documentation and provide relevant information with source citations, allowing you to trace where the information came from.

### 4.2 Code Understanding

The Code Understanding feature helps you understand code snippets and patterns used in your organization.

**How to use it:**

1. Share a code snippet using Slack's code block formatting (triple backticks)
   ````
   ```python
   def authenticate_user(username, password):
       user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()
       if user and user.check_password(password):
           return generate_token(user)
       return None
   ```
   ````

2. Ask for an explanation
   ```
   @Konveyor Can you explain what this code does?
   ```

3. Ask about specific aspects
   ```
   @Konveyor How does the token generation work in this code?
   ```

Konveyor will analyze the code and provide explanations tailored to your organization's coding patterns and conventions.

### 4.3 Knowledge Gap Analyzer

The Knowledge Gap Analyzer helps identify areas where you might need additional information or training.

**How to use it:**

1. Start a knowledge assessment
   ```
   @Konveyor Can you analyze my knowledge gaps about our microservices architecture?
   ```

2. Answer the questions Konveyor asks to assess your understanding

3. Review the analysis and recommendations
   ```
   @Konveyor What should I learn next based on our previous conversation?
   ```

Konveyor will track your confidence in different knowledge areas and suggest resources to help you fill any gaps.

## 5. Advanced Usage

### 5.1 Follow-up Questions

Konveyor maintains conversation context, allowing you to ask follow-up questions without repeating all the details:

Initial question:
```
How do I deploy to the staging environment?
```

Follow-up:
```
What permissions do I need for that?
```

Another follow-up:
```
And how do I verify the deployment was successful?
```

### 5.2 Providing Feedback

You can provide feedback on Konveyor's responses using Slack reactions:

- üëç (thumbs up): Indicates the response was helpful
- üëé (thumbs down): Indicates the response wasn't helpful

This feedback helps improve Konveyor's responses over time.

### 5.3 Combining Features

You can combine Konveyor's features for more comprehensive assistance:

```
@Konveyor I'm trying to understand our authentication system. Can you explain this code snippet and point me to relevant documentation?

```python
def verify_token(token):
    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=["HS256"])
        return payload
    except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
        return None
    except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
        return None
```
```

## 6. Troubleshooting

### 6.1 Common Issues

**Konveyor doesn't respond:**
