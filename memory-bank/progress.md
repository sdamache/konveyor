# Progress: Konveyor

## What Works

- Core Django application modules for documents, search, RAG, and core utilities are implemented and structured.
- Azure Cognitive Search is integrated and used for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in the current demo.
- Document ingestion, chunking, embedding, and indexing workflows are functional.
- Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform) provisions key Azure resources: Cognitive Search, Key Vault, OpenAI, Document Intelligence, Storage, and partial Bot Service.
- Unit and integration test scaffolding exists for core RAG workflows and services.

## What's Left to Build

- **Azure App Service Deployment:** The Django application is not yet deployed to Azure App Service; this is critical for validating end-to-end Azure integration and production readiness.
- **Bot Integration:** Slack/Bot Framework integration is incomplete; the agent is not yet accessible via chat interfaces.
- **Agent Orchestration:** The orchestration layer for routing requests to Semantic Kernel skills/tools is not fully implemented.
- **Semantic Kernel Skills:** Documentation Navigator, Code Understanding, and Knowledge Gap Analyzer skills are not yet complete or integrated.
- **Redis Cache and Cosmos DB:** These are not active; all retrieval and context are currently handled via Azure AI Search. Transition to Redis/Cosmos DB for cost optimization is planned for the future.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Needs enhancement for integration testing and automated deployment to Azure App Service.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Full system integration and user journey tests are pending.
- **Documentation and Demo:** Comprehensive user and architecture documentation, as well as a demo script, are not yet finalized.

## Current Status

- The project is in an advanced development stage but is not yet end-to-end demo-ready.
- Retrieval and RAG features work using Azure AI Search, but advanced agentic features (Semantic Kernel skills, orchestration, chat integration) are still in progress.
- Infrastructure is partially provisioned; App Service deployment is a major missing component.
- The next steps and implementation plan are defined in detail in the tasks folder and scripts/prd_draft_for_ai.txt, which should be followed to complete the MVP.

## Known Issues

- No active Redis cache or Cosmos DB for conversation context; all context is handled via Azure AI Search.
- Bot integration is incomplete; no live chat interface for the agent.
- App Service deployment is missing, blocking full Azure integration testing.
- Some infrastructure modules may require updates or fixes for production deployment.
- End-to-end and user journey tests are not yet implemented.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Initial focus on Azure AI Search for rapid demo; Redis and Cosmos DB are planned for future cost and performance optimization.
- Modular infrastructure and codebase design to support phased rollout of agentic features and cloud services.
- Task breakdown and development roadmap are managed via the tasks folder and PRD draft for AI-driven, structured implementation.
